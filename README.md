# Hey, I'm Muuo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a veteran Go server-side developer with a passion for building scalable, high-performance systems. Right now, I'm working on **StylIQ**, a project that brings **virtual try-on technology** to e-commerce. My goal is to make shopping online as smooth and intuitive as possible by exploring the potential of **AI**, **Computer Vision**, and **Augmented Reality (AR)**.

### What I'm Working On
- Building the backend infrastructure for **StylIQ** using Go.
- Integrating AI to improve how we map clothing onto users in real-time.
- Exploring **AR** for real-time try-on experiences.

### What I Do
- **Server-Side Development**: Specializing in Go to build scalable and efficient APIs.
- **AI & AR**: Learning and applying **Computer Vision** and **Augmented Reality** to bring new ideas to life.
- **#BuildingInPublic**: Sharing my progress, challenges, and solutions on social media.
